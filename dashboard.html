      <p>This project was intended to have a dashboard just like our EVSU portal. 
      These includes a three dashboard in the upper side of the webpage and a
      list of information below in which you can search a data by just typing its 
      ID, Name, Email or Number. </p>
      <p>The Step to make a dashboard are:
        <br>
        <br> Step 1: make a html file named as "index.html" and code your texts.
        <br>
        <br> Step 2: make a css file to design your html and connect your css into your html. And start coding for designs.
        <br>
        <br> Step 3: last step is to test and run your webpage. </p>
